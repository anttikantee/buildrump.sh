Rump Kernels for POSIX Hosts
============================

The buildrump.sh script builds unmodified NetBSD kernel drivers such
as file systems and the TCP/IP stack as components for hosts such as
Linux and BSDs.  These components can be linked in a variety
of configurations to form *rump kernels*, which provide services to
applications directly on the host.  The benefits of this approach include
avoiding the overhead of OS virtualization.  Also, root privileges are
not mandated.

An example use case is [fs-utils](http://github.com/stacktic/fs-utils)
which uses rump kernels to access file system images.  Another example
is using the TCP/IP stack in conjunction with the Data Plane Development
Kit, available [here](http://github.com/anttikantee/dpdk-rumptcpip).

The links for some of packages are provided by the
[openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=rump&project=home%3Astaal1978). 
You can download and install the packages manually, but it is highly recommended to add the OBS repositories for the right distro and architecture to the package manager. This way, updates and dependencies will be automatically resolved other packages depending on rump kernels.


Building from Source Code
=========================

Building from source may be necessary of there are no binary packages
for your systems, or if you wish to source level modifications to the
rump kernel components.

Build dependencies
------------------

The following are required for building from source:

- cc (gcc and clang are known to work)
- ld (GNU or Solaris ld required)
- binutils (ar, nm, objcopy)

The short version
-----------------

Clone the repository and run:

- `./buildrump.sh`

You will now find the kernel drivers and necessary headers in `./rump`
ready for use.  Examples on how to use the resulting drivers are available
in the `tests` and `examples` directories.

The long(er) version
--------------------

When run without parameters, `buildrump.sh` implicitly assumes that the
given commands were `checkout fullbuild`.  You can override this default
by giving explicit commands.

The `checkout` command will fetch the necessary subset of the NetBSD
source tree from github into `./src`.  You are free to use any method
for fetching NetBSD sources, though the only officially supported way
is to let the script handle the checkout.

The `fullbuild` command will then instruct the script to to build the
necessary set of tools for building rump kernels, e.g. the BSD version
of `make`, after which it will build the rump kernels.  By default,
`cc` from path is used along with other host tools such as `nm`.
Crosscompilation is documented further below.

If the command `tests` or `fullbuild` is given, the script will run simple
tests to check that e.g. file systems and the TCP/IP stack work correctly.
If everything was successfully completed, the final output from the
script is "Success".

To learn more about command line parameters, run the buildrump.sh
script with the `-h` flag.

Crosscompiling
--------------

If the environment variable `$CC` is set, its value is used as the compiler
instead of `cc`.  This allows not only to select between compiling with
gcc or clang, but also allows to specify a crosscompiler.  If `$CC` is set
and does not contain the value `cc`, `gcc`, or `clang` the script assumes
a crosscompiler and will use tools with names based on the target of
`$CC` with the format `target-tool` (e.g. `target-nm`).

Crosscompiling for an ARM system might look like this (first command
is purely informational):

	$ arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -dumpmachine
	arm-linux-gnueabihf
	$ env CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc ./buildrump.sh [params]

Since the target is `arm-linux-gnueabihf`, `arm-linux-gnueabihf-nm` etc.
must be found from `$PATH`.  The assumption is that the crosscompiler
can find the target platform headers and libraries which are required
for building the hypervisor.


Tested hosts
============

Continuous testing on Linux/amd64 + gcc/clang is done by
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/anttikantee/buildrump.sh)
for every commit.

Examples of hosts buildrump.sh has manually been tested on are
as follows:

There is also initial support for Cygwin, but it will not work
out-of-the-box due to object format issues (ELF vs. PE-COFF).
Mac OS X is likely to require support for its linker.


Tip(s) for advanced users
=========================

Place your buildtools in a separate directory, e.g. `$HOME/rumptools`
using `./buildrump.sh -T $HOME/rumptools tools`.  Put that directory in
`$PATH`.  You can now do fast build interation for kernel components by
going to the appropriate directory and running `rumpmake dependall &&
rumpmake install`.
